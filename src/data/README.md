## Task #11
*Data Structures and Algorithms*

Your task is to demonstrate your knowledge of data structures (stack, queue, tree, graph, linked list) and implement algorithms to solve specific problems related to these data structures in JavaScript.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Data Structure Implementations

1. **Stack**: Implement a class for a stack data structure. Include methods for push, pop, and peek.
2. **Queue**: Implement a class for a queue data structure. Include methods for enqueue, dequeue, and peek.
3. **Binary Tree**: Implement a class for a binary tree data structure. Include methods for inserting nodes, searching for a node, and traversing the tree (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order).
4. **Graph**: Implement a class for a graph data structure. Include methods for adding vertices and edges, performing depth-first search (DFS), and breadth-first search (BFS).
5. **Linked List**: Implement a class for a singly linked list data structure. Include methods for inserting nodes, deleting nodes, and searching for a node.

#### Part 2: Algorithmic Problems

1. **Min/Max Stack**: Implement a class for a stack that supports finding the minimum and maximum elements in constant time (O(1)). Include methods for push, pop, getMin, and getMax.
2. **Binary Search Tree**: Implement a function to determine if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST). Provide an efficient algorithm that checks whether the tree satisfies the BST property.
3. **Graph Algorithms**: Implement algorithms to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph using both Dijkstra's algorithm and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
4. **Linked List Cycle**: Implement a function to detect if a linked list has a cycle. Use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare algorithm) to solve this problem efficiently.

#### Part 3: Demonstration

1. **Usage Demonstration**: Create instances of your data structures and demonstrate their usage with sample data. Show how the algorithms you implemented can solve practical problems using these data structures.

#### Part 4: Documentation

1. **Documentation**: Provide clear and concise comments and documentation for your code. Explain the purpose of each data structure, method, and algorithm. Describe how the algorithms work and their time complexity.

### Submission
Submit your JavaScript code along with detailed documentation and comments that explain your data structure implementations and algorithms. Ensure that your code is well-structured and adheres to best practices in data structures and algorithms.

### Example
For example, your code might look like this:
```javascript
class Stack {
    // Implement methods for push, pop, peek...
}

class Queue {
    // Implement methods for enqueue, dequeue, peek...
}

class BinaryTree {
    // Implement methods for inserting nodes, searching, traversing...
}

class Graph {
    // Implement methods for adding vertices, edges, DFS, BFS...
}

class LinkedList {
    // Implement methods for inserting, deleting, searching...
}

// Implement Min/Max Stack, Binary Search Tree, Graph Algorithms...
// Demonstrate usage and provide documentation...
```

### Bonus

*Implementing a Red-Black Tree*

As a bonus challenge, you are tasked with implementing a Red-Black Tree data structure in JavaScript. Red-Black Trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. This exercise will deepen your understanding of tree structures and balancing algorithms.

### Instructions

1. **Red-Black Tree Implementation**: Create a class for a Red-Black Tree that includes methods for insertion, deletion, and searching. Implement the Red-Black Tree balancing rules to ensure that the tree remains balanced after each operation.
2. **Insertion**: Implement the insertion operation for the Red-Black Tree. Ensure that the tree maintains the Red-Black properties, including colorings and rotations as necessary.
3. **Deletion**: Implement the deletion operation for the Red-Black Tree. Handle cases for both removing nodes with no children, one child, and two children while preserving the Red-Black properties.
4. **Search**: Implement a method to search for a specific value in the Red-Black Tree. Ensure that the search operation is efficient and respects the tree's structure.

### Submission

Submit your JavaScript code for the Red-Black Tree implementation along with detailed comments and documentation explaining your implementation. Provide examples of inserting, deleting, and searching for values in the Red-Black Tree.
