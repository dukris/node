## Task #3
*Immutability and Pure Functions:*
1. Implement a pure function called `calculateDiscountedPrice` that takes an array of products and a discount percentage as arguments. The function should return a new array of products with discounted prices based on the given percentage, without modifying the original products.
2. Create a pure function called `calculateTotalPrice` that takes an array of products as an argument. The function should return the total price of all products, without modifying the original array or its items.

*Function Composition and Point-Free Style:*
1. Implement a function called `getFullName` that takes a person object with `firstName` and `lastName` properties. The function should return the person's full name in the format "FirstName LastName".
2. Create a function called `filterUniqueWords` that takes a string of text and returns an array of unique words, sorted in alphabetical order, without using explicit loops. Use function composition and point-free style.
3. Implement a function called `getAverageGrade` that takes an array of student objects, each containing a `name` and `grades` property. The function should return the average grade of all students, without modifying the original array or its items. Use function composition and point-free style.

*Closures and Higher-Order Functions:*
1. Create a function called `createCounter` that returns a closure. The closure should be a counter function that increments the count on each call and returns the updated count. Each closure should have its own independent count.
2. Implement a higher-order function called `repeatFunction` that takes a function and a number as arguments. The function should return a new function that invokes the original function multiple times based on the provided number. If the number is negative, the new function should invoke the original function indefinitely until stopped.

*Recursion and Tail Call Optimization:*
1. Implement a recursive function called `calculateFactorial` that calculates the factorial of a given number. Optimize the function to use tail call optimization to avoid stack overflow for large input numbers.
2. Create a recursive function called `power` that takes a base and an exponent as arguments. The function should calculate the power of the base to the exponent using recursion.

*Lazy Evaluation and Generators:*
1. Implement a lazy evaluation function called `lazyMap` that takes an array and a mapping function. The function should return a lazy generator that applies the mapping function to each element of the array one at a time.
2. Create a lazy generator function called `fibonacciGenerator` that generates Fibonacci numbers one at a time using lazy evaluation.
